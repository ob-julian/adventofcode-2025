Disclaimer: This repo shows my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. The general coding style may vary and is usually not the level of polish I normally strive for. The main goal here is to solve the challenges, not to write perfect code that works in every edge case and fails safely.

>Note: The runtimes are measured on my local machine using the included [average_runtime.py](./average_runtime.py) script. It measures raw execution time without any writing to console or files. Furthermore, the files are imported as modules, so any lib overhead (cough Numpy cough) and Input parsing is not included in the measurement. It only measures the raw execution time of the solver functions.
